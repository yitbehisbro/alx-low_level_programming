<h2>Requirements</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
<li>Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs</li>
<li>All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89</li>
<li>All your files should end with a new line</li>
<li>A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory</li>
<li>Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using <a href="https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl">betty-style.pl</a> and <a href="https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl">betty-doc.pl<a/a></li>
<li>You are not allowed to use global variables</li>
<li>No more than 5 functions per file</li>
<li>You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden</li>
<li>You are allowed to use _putchar</li>
<li>You don’t have to push <a href="https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c">_putchar.c</a>, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account</li>
<li>In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples</li>
<li>The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h</li>
<li>Don’t forget to push your header file</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tasks</h2>
<p>0. Write a function that checks for uppercase character.</p>
<p>1. Write a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).</p>
<p>2. Write a function that multiplies two integers.</p>
<p>3. Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.</p>
<p>4. Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.</p>
<p>5. Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.</p>
<p>6. Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.</p>
<p>7. Write a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.</p>
<p>8. Write a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.</p>
<p>9. The “Fizz-Buzz test” is an interview question designed to help filter out the 99.5% of programming job candidates who can’t seem to program their way out of a wet paper bag.

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.</p>
<p>10. Write a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.</p>
<p>11. The prime factors of 1231952 are 2, 2, 2, 2, 37 and 2081.

Write a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line.</p>
<p>12. Write a function that prints an integer.
Prototype: void print_number(int n);
You can only use _putchar function to print
You are not allowed to use long
You are not allowed to use arrays or pointers
You are not allowed to hard-code special values</p>
